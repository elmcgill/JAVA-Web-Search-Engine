# JAVA-Web-Search-Engine
COMS 311 Programming Project 1

A JAVA based web search engine made by creating a web graph using jsoup and a depth first search and custon graph object.
We used the graph created by BFS to allow us to have a graph of websites to scrape and create an important word index.
Using the index you could search for websites that would be relevant to your search word or words.
